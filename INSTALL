DPO installation
================

Windows
-------

    Prerequisites
    -------------

    CTA
    ---
        This tool helps manage Windows environment variables.

        Get it from https://github.com/htalbot/cta-win_env_vars_editor.git.

        Download cta.exe from the bin directory and copy it into a directory
        of your choice.

    Perl
    ----

        DPO is written in Perl because it is based on MPC (www.ociweb.com)
        that is written in Perl.

        Get it from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads and
        install it.

        Install additional packages. From a console, launch:

            ppm install Win32::Env

            ppm install File::Type

            ppm install Tie::IxHash

            ppm repo add http://www.wxperl.co.uk/repo29
            ppm install wx

            ppm install XML::LibXML

        If not all these packages can be installed, install an older version.

    DPO
    ---

        Get it from https://github.com/htalbot/DPOpp.git.

            I'm used to install it in C:\dev

                => C:\dev\dpo

            We can download a zip file or clone it with git.

        Install a starting pool.

            Actually, there are two starting pools: i686 (32 bits) and
            x86_64 (64 bits). According to the needs, it is possible to install
            one of them or both.

            From C:\dev\dpo\templates\pools, choose a pool and copy it
            in C:\dev\dpo_pool-<arch>-<os>. Where <arch> is 'x86_64' or 'i686'
            and os is 'windows'. Again, C:\dev is my directory of choice.

            For example: C:\dev\dpo_pool-x86_64-windows

        Define environment variables (with CTA).

            If you don't want to define variables manually, you can follow
            instructions described further (A slightly faster way to define DPO
            environment variables).

            DPO_CORE_ROOT = C:\dev\dpo\core

            DPO_PRIVATE_TEMPLATES_ROOT = ...

                This variable can be empty.

                This variable allows DPO to get additional project/layer
                templates that are not part of DPO itself.

                For example, DPO_PRIVATE_TEMPLATES_ROOT can be assigned to
                these two directories:

                    C:\dev\src\acme\ApplicationABC\templates4dpo
                    C:\dev\src\acme\ApplicationDEF\templates4dpo

                Note that each directory must have templates4dpo as leaf.

            DPO_TEMPLATES_ROOT = C:\dev\dpo\templates

            DPO_POOL_ROOT = ...

                From here, there are two ways to define this variable. For the
                sake of documentation, I suppose dpo_pool-x86_64-windows is the
                one I want to use.

                    - with CTA

                        DPO_POOL_ROOT = C:\dev\dpo_pool-x86_64-windows

                    - from Windows Explorer (file manager)

                        Double-clic on dpo_set_as_current_pool.pl from the root
                        C:\dev\dpo_pool-x86_64-windows.

            ACE_ROOT = ...

                ACE_ROOT in the context of DPO, must be defined with a directory
                in a pool. This directory must be such as

                    %DPO_POOL_ROOT%\vc10\thirdparty\Vanderbilt\ACE\<flavour>\<version>

                    ... this directory being generated by dpo.pl.

                Since we install DPO for the first time, this directory doesn't
                exist yet. So, we set ACE_ROOT as

                    C:\dev\dpo_pool-x86_64-windows\vc10\thirdparty\Vanderbilt\ACE\minimal_for_dpo\6.3.1

                Once we have built a specific version of ACE, we can push it
                into the pool with dpo.pl (External product migration/MPC Compliant).

            MPC_ROOT = %ACE_ROOT%\MPC

                For those who know ACE and MPC, know that DPO lets you
                choose the type of export file to generate. The one generated
                by MPC/mpc.pl or the one generated by ACE/bin/mpc.pl.

            A slightly faster way to define DPO environment variables:

                - Copy dpo\dpo_env_vars.cta file into C:\cat_back (create this
                  directory if it doesn't exist)
                - Make sure that the path (C:\dev\dpo) is the right one (maybe
                  C:\dev is not where you installed DPO)
                - Launch CTA
                    - Click on button 'Import...'
                    - Select dpo_env_vars.cta and click 'Next...'
                    - Select all variables and click on 'Import variables'.
