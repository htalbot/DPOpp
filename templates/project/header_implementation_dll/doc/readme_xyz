Template header_implementation
------------------------------

Sometimes, implementation takes place in header file. These files should also
be monitored at the level of versions. That is why we make a specific project
for haeder files.

As usual, the header file contains a class as guideline only.

After applying modifications according to the needs, this project
just have to be built and tested with its test_app (if not removed
from the workspace).
