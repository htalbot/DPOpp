Instructions for building xyz as a corba object with TAO
---------------------------------------------------------

    - Implement the object

        - Open xyz/include/xyz/related_object_i.h

                - Adapt object interface according to the Corba interface.

        - Open xyz/src/related_object_i.cpp

                - Adapt object implementation according to the Corba interface.

        - Build library


    - Implement test application (server)

        - Open xyz/test_xyz/test_xyzAppLayer.cpp

            - Define OBJ_ID_REF that is used to access the object from outside
              the server.

        - Build server application


    - Implement test application (client)

        - Open xyz/test_xyz_client/test_xyz_clientAppLayer.cpp

            - Define OBJ_ID_REF that refers to the object to be used.

            - Replace HOST:PORT by values corresponding to
              the ones passed to server.

            - Use the object according to the interface.

        - Build client application


    - Run

        - Starting the server

            (release) xyz -ORBListenEndPoints iiop://localhost:10000
            (debug) xyzd -ORBListenEndPoints iiop://localhost:10000

                The server will wait for requests.

                Notice that iiop is the same as the one set in client
                application.

        - Starting the client

            (release) test_xyz_client
            (debug) test_xyz_clientd
