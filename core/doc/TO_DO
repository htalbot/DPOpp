- TO_DO: solve all TO_DO found in source code.

- Linux: make dpo wroking in Linux

- Code revue

- Impact

- Packaging - DPOPanelPool - production definition - load_products:

    - identify selected pool

    - exclude modules

- get_project - present in DPOPanelProduct and DPOPanelPool: should we use only
  one (->DPOUtils)?

- Bug: Create a library (libX) with no test. Thereafter, create an executable
       with the name test_libX. This involves lib5 as static

- Workspace projects:

    - refresh at the end only.

    - add a show mpc menu

- DPOPanelProduct: when including a project in the current one, it's possible
                   that we have to select an mpb. When we select one (for
                   example a dynamic one) --> we still need to choose
                   dynamic/static after having selected mpb.

- When we edit features file (ex.: wxwindows=1), we have to restart dpo because
  features have not been refreshed.

- Import wx: make features be updated automatically.

- DPOPool
    - activation: add validation on product dependencies

    - Show products according to a product (according to its dependencies)

- Doc:

    - how to make a template

    - how to make a layer

- DPOActions - validate_project: check if modules exists for specified
               types (debug/release)

- Compare 2 pools to see which products are in a pool but not in the other

- Flavour: mean to show description of a flavour

- DPOPanelProduct:

    - when creating a new product, create a default workspace
      containing all projects. Each time a project is created,
      include it in the all workspace

    - managing workspace: add, delete, copy

    - managing mru

        - ordered by name or by time

        - add, delete

- Use of get_text (multilang)

- msg_list: is there a maximum length for a column ? (wxWidgets)

- DPOPanelProduct:

    - hide 'Layers...' button when project is of type Abstract

- Validate inputs everywhere: for ex. when we let a user enter a path, we
                              want to validate if the path exists.

- version.rc

    - product name/version absent

    - project version -> product version.

- templates:

    - header_abstract_class_dll/header_implementation_dll:

        - Why _dll?

        - Is there an incidence if I remove _dll?

- DPOPanelProduct: remove a project (hide DPOProject.xml)

- Layer ace_plugin: prevent static

- Layer: is it possible to rollback ?

- Layer - dialog_obj_and_ift_names: describe more each field in any circumstance

- Layer - tao_client: suggest to use test_tao_server of object

- xml: improve the code interfacing with xml file (better definition/distinction
       between node and element)

- use of wxGlage-0.7.1 or more recent

- DPOProductWorkspaceProjectSideDlg: enlarge column.

- DPOPostbuild.pm

    - For non product local dependencies, copy runtimes
    - Copy non compliant dependencies
