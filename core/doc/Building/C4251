Warning C4251
=============

Since we use DPO, consistency is ensured between modules at the
level of arch, OS and toochain. This allows us to benefit, among other
things, of the use of stl in C++ interfaces. For this reason, we don't care
about warning C4251 and we can deactivate it.

Note: C4251 can be ignored if you are deriving from a type in the Standard C++
Library, compiling a debug release (/MTd) and where the compiler error message
refers to _Container_base. (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/esew7y1w.aspx)
